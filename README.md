Step 1:
Download apache tomcat on your PC.

Step 2:
Write a code saying Hello "Name" using the servlet api jar.

Step 3:
Add the module servlet-api.jar to the Project Structure of your project.

"javac -cp $PATH$\apache-tomcat-8.5.85\lib\servlet-api.jar HelloServlet.java"

Step 5:
Copy the Bytecode generated by the compiler to "$PATH$\apache-tomcat-8.5.85\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\classes"

Step 6:
Configure web.xml in WEB-INF to add the pathes to the Server

Step 7:
Run the server by running "startup.bat" in "$PATH\apache-tomcat-8.5.85\bin"

Now Everything is set up and change the code as you like!
